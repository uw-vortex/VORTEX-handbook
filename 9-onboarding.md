## Onboarding

## Keys and Credentials
You will need the following access cards and keys to work in the lab:
* [WatCard](https://uwaterloo.ca/watcard/) (Student Card)
* FOB for hallways
* Keys

## Health & Safety
All members of the VORTE lab need to take the following courses prior to working in the lab. All courses (except TCPS2) can be accessed through the [UW Workday](https://uwaterloo.ca/human-resources/) website --> Learning --> Self-enrollment.
* Employee Safety Orientation (SO1001)
* Workplace Violence & Harassment Awareness (SO1081)
* AccessAbility for Ontarians with Disabilites Act (AODA) Awareness
* WHMIS 2015 Training (SO2017 - or later)
* [TCPS2 Ethics](https://tcps2core.ca/) Certificate

I would also like everyone to try and take the First Aid course (SO1038) when it becomes available. This full day course will give you Standard First Aid and CPR C with AED training, which is an incredible package for single-day training. It does not hurt to be prepared in the lab with participants coming in and performing exercise trials in a new environment.

## Supervisory Onboarding
At the start of every studentship (undergrad and grad), students will meet one-on-one with Jason in the first month of term to establish some core values and expectations for mentorship throughout their time in the lab. In this meeting we will discuss:
* Expected response times for communications;
* Best ways to keep on top of drafts, applications, and meetings;
* Mentorship meeting frequency and structure;
* Working habits;
* Time off / vacations;
* Strategies to stay 'on time' for program milestones (proposal, committee meetings, defenses);
* Teaching and volunteer interests;
* Career plans and goals;
* Conference plan and funding expectations;
* Publishing and authorship expectations;
* Expectations to apply for external funding;
* Responsibility for research ethics;
