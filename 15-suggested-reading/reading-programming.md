# Coding and Programming Essentials

## R Resources
We will be using Studio as the primary software for data statistics and figures. The following are a few excellent resources to get you started on your R journey.

## Data Management

### Expectations for reproducible code
All final versions of code must be commented to provide enough detail to allow a new user to interpret and adapt your work for either new purposes or recreate your analysis plan. This includes appropriate version numbers and dates, section headers (where appropriate), and contextualized variable names (i.e., NOT var1, var2, var3). This is easiest to manage from the start, so set those good habits early!

### Analysis Resources
All previous analysis resources can either be found on the lab GitHub repository, or in the lab network folder.

### Final datasets
All final datasets should use a standardized layout where rows are individual participants, and columns are outcome measures. If you are working with repeated measures data, each timepoint will be replicated in the wide format for readability, but will likely be transformed to long format in R for analysis.
