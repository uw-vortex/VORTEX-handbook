# Open Science

Open science refers to the evolving understanding of how we as scientists can best communicate our work with colleagues, the community, and society. As a lab, we will make decisions on how best to make data, code, and papers freely available to the public. The following notes are the beginning steps in this policy.

* Code: Final code for all projects need to be annotated, confirmed reproducible by an independent lab member, and uploaded to the lab's GitHub repository. The idea is for this code to eventually be made open access to our collaborators and our community, pending rigorous internal- and peer-review.

* Preprints: Preprints refer to the upload of a completed manuscript to a online repository where it can be read by the public, prior to the peer-review process. The advantages of this system allow the rapid "pre-publication" of important research findings in advance of a possible ~6 month delay in the peer-review process. This strategy has not yet gained mainstream popularity within human physiological sciences. We are currently exploring the benefits of this in our lab, and are receptive to trying new approaches to open science in physiology.

* Registered Reports: These reports are published evidence of the thought process behind a study, contributing accountability for study results before the study actually takes place. The only physiology journal that offers Registered Reports is Experimental Physiology, where you submit your introduction, objectives, hypotheses, methods, and analysis plan for peer-review. If the Report is accepted, you can then proceed to starting your study and the journal promises to publish the results regardless of negative publishing bias. The goal of these Reports is to allow research to be conducted without pressure of positive findings, just an answer to a well-designed question.

* Lab materials: Sharing lab data and materials (i.e., procedures, data, raw files, codes) should always first go through the lab PI (Jason) to ensure we are following University policies in collaborating with external institutions.

* Researchgate: The website researchgate.com can be considered the "Facebook for research" and is a somewhat public forum to post papers, data, and achievements to gain visibility within your network. You are free to use this platform how you choose, however, I ask that you adhere to journal copyright laws outlined below:
    1. **Public full texts**: Only upload the full text viewable to the public if we have chosen an open-access publication option (it would also be free on the journal website), or if the journal allows posting in pre/post copyedited forms. You can check journal preferences at the [SHERPA/ROMEO website](sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/).
    2. **Private full texts**: You can always upload the full final copy-edited text in private, ready for sharing to individual requests. Regardless of the journal policies, as an author, you do have the right to distribute personal copies of our papers to anyone who asks. The trouble begins when you make the paper widely and freely available to the public.
