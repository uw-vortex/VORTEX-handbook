# COVID Lab Advisements

# The Ontario government has imposed a lockdown from December 24, 2020 to January 23, 2021, now extended to February 19, 2020. Current recommendations indicate we can continue safety-plan-approved lab activities that do not involve face-to-face human research.

## Required Training
All lab members who will be working on campus are required to take the following course on LEARN:
* SO 2036: Return to Campus Safety during COVID-19

You can access this course by logging into LEARN and clicking 'Self Registration' at the top of the page. Search for SO 2036, enroll, and you should see the module appear in your list of courses.

## Access to the Lab
Only pre-approved personnel will have access to the on-campus lab facilities to limit unnecessary risk exposure during the term. A list of approved members can be found in the Lab Safety Plan on the V: drive.

There is an occupancy limit of *two people* in the lab at any given time. Access will be tracked through the lab calendar, hosted on Outlook.

## Working along during COVID-19
Working Alone in the laboratory is a possibility, but it is unlikely that you would be the only person in the building during designated hours (08:00-18:00h). There will likely be other individuals working on the 2nd floor of BMH (physiology), or in the biomechanics labs on the 1st floor of BMH. Emergency contacts on the UW campus are posted on the lab cork board (Jason Au, Emma Dare, Campus Security, EMS, 911). There are no tasks in the laboratory that are considered dangerous for working alone.

## Ramp-down and Temporary Shut-down procedures
In the event of a lab shutdown (i.e., campus closure due to Provincial lockdown), all in-person lab activities must cease. The following needs to occur to safely shut down the lab:
* All equipment should be unplugged and lights turned off
* Incoming shipments need to be identified and determined essential or not (i.e., will anything spoil or melt)
* The above tasks will be completed by Jason Au

## Emergency contacts
Police services: dial 911 on any phone
Campus police: 519-888-4567 x22222
UW Health services: 519-888-4567 x84096

Lab contact list can be found on the V: drive in case of emergencies
