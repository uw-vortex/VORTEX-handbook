# Roles & Expectations

## Everyone
### Code of Conduct
There are many topics we could discuss, but the main focus in this lab is Respect. I expect you all to treat those in your working environment with the same respect and courtesies to promote a positive work environment. Communication should be kind, courteous, and timely. You should not abuse positions of power for personal gain (e.g., supervisory or TA roles), and any such conflicts should be identified early. Any disagreements or breaches of conduct should be identified to the PI, and if necessary, the Graduate Studies chair in Kinesiology (Steve Fischer: steven.fischer@uwaterloo.ca).

The general student code of conduct for the University of Waterloo can be found  [on the UW website](https://uwaterloo.ca/english-language-institute/current-eli-students/efas-student-handbook/student-code-conduct).

### Scientific Integrity
Throughout your studies, you will no doubt feel the pressure to produce research, report positive findings, and share exciting results. While it is great to be motivated, remember that you should put integrity above all and do not falsify information, manipulate images, or adjust data to serve personal goals. All findings are important (e.g., finding no difference in vascular health between healthy and diseased populations is still positive!), and it is essential that we and our collaborators can trust data coming out of the lab.


## Principal Investigator
Within the lab, my main roles include finding grant money to keep the lights on, mentoring trainees joining the lab, and acting as the main resource in the pipeline for experimental design and data interpretation. I have a casual open-door policy for trainees and always have my phone and email nearby for research or personal emergencies. While not a taskmaster, I will try to keep you on target for your personal research and career goals, and will try to *constructively* push you out of your comfort zone.

Jason's working policies:
* I will acknowledge your emails within 24hrs on working days;
* I request at least 2 weeks notice for writing / reviews requests from students. This includes paper drafts, thesis edits, reference letters, and scholarship applications;


In addition to the above, I promise to:
* Support you in your research life and student life (if you ask);
* Be available for meetings on a regular basis;
* Be patient during the learning process for many lab techniques that you may never have heard of prior to joining the lab (there will be lots!);
* Respond within a reasonable time (<24 hours) to your emails and messages, even if just an acknowledgement of receipt;
* Advocate for your wellness at the upper administrative levels, when possible;
* Encourage and promote equity and diversity in the lab by creating and filling opportunities based on lived experiences that enhance existing perspectives in the lab, and recognizing bias in privileged experiences for which not all individuals have access; and,
* Help you navigate your career path after leaving the lab. This can include helping you network with others at conferences, or helping plan studies directly related to career prospects.

FROM THE STUDENTS: We expect Jason to:
* Provide an opportunity for us to develop as an independent researcher and to foster an atmosphere of learning;
* To take into account student’s goals and to assist students in working towards them (within reason);
* Challenge students to learn new skills relevant to working in the lab;
* Provide constructive criticism and feedback of the students' work;
* Be available to students during office hours and at times arranged by mutual agreement and communicate when not able to be there;
* Assess student performance as objectively as possible;
* Promote an environment that fosters collaborative work, and reduces competition;
* Share his excitement about his work and developments in the field with his students; and
* Set clear work deadlines (ex. micro deadlines, soft, and hard deadlines) and work with students to set them.


## Research Graduate Students
Within the lab, the main role for graduate students is, first and foremost, to be students. You are not employees and I do not expect you to work as such. Graduate students are expected to work through your courses, set realistic goals unique to your objectives, and work towards those goals through whatever means you learn best. Senior graduate students are expected to offer support to junior students, and in turn, junior students are expected to reach out for help from senior students to share knowledge within the team.

In addition to the above, graduate students are expected to:
* Work towards your research objectives, developed in conjunction with Jason and your supervisory committee;
* Plan regular meetings with your supervisory team to meet your research needs;
* Apply for external scholarships;
* Mentor junior lab members;
* Keep detailed research notes throughout your studies;
* Keep track of departmental and external deadlines, and to remind Jason when he forgets; and,
* Maintain a work-life balance that suits your needs! Determine what works best for you and take time to try out new strategies. Grad school is the perfect time to find out if you are a morning person, night owl, weekend warrior, or biphasic sleeper.

FROM THE STUDENTS: We expect our graduate student peers to:
* Take the time to explain your projects to junior students and answer questions regarding lab projects and grad school;
* Give students the opportunity to shadow/follow your work as it progresses; and,
* Share your passion for science!

## Coursework Graduate Students
The coursework-based MSc program offers unique opportunities to participate in single-term research projects through the KIN 680 course. Within the VORTEX Lab, single-term MSc students will be invited to participate as full members of the lab in addition to the formal structure of the KIN 680 course. Coursework students operate in somewhat of a vague space between experienced lab members and senior undergraduate students, with expectations in day-to-day leadership and increased responsibility appropriate for their year of study. Although our time together will be short, we will work together to realize clear research goals for the term and provide a sneak peek into the day-to-day operations of a research lab experience!

In addition to the above, coursework graduate students are expected to:
* Mentor undergraduate students and act as leaders in the lab to provoke critical thought in research topics of interest;
* Work towards term goals, with clear endpoints for summative course elements; and,
* Contribute to research discussions, drawing on personal experiences and fresh knowledge for concurrent graduate courses.

FROM THE STUDENTS: We expect our coursework graduate student peers to:
* Be open in sharing what they are working on to encourage overlapping research interests;
* Be open to share guidance about the graduate studies process and job market; and,
* Be open to discussing individual research question and ask thought-provoking questions about research projects in the lab.


## Undergraduate coursework students (KIN 391 / KIN 431/ KIN 472)
Within the lab, the main role of coursework students is first and foremost to be students. I understand that you may also be taking other classes, as well as juggling other responsibilities, so you will not be asked to focus all your time and energy on this one course. Remember to  take care of your mental health and communicate when you have "hell week" coming up. The benefit of taking a research course is the flexibility it offers in terms of scheduling work time and deadlines. Regardless, you are still expected  to attend lab meetings and meet deadlines mutually agreed upon between you and Jason, and communicate when unable to do so. Please note, you are NOT expected to end the term with a paper publication or having designed and conducted a experimental research study.

As coursework students, you are expected to do the following:
* Conduct a literature review, collect data, perform data analysis, or any other project mutually agreed upon before the start of the term, which contributes to the goals and objectives of the lab;
* Keep detailed notes on progress of research for the duration of the course so that this can be passed down to subsequent researchers;
* Present research findings at the end of the term during a team meeting;
* Plan and schedule regular meetings with Jason to check in;
* Participate actively during team meetings; and,
* Plan for a rough time commitment of no more than 6-8 hours/week for 12 weeks of the term (recommended by the Department to roughly manage your course load).

FROM THE STUDENTS: We expect our courseware student peers to:
* Take initiative - you have to be self-motivated to secure your interests and don’t be passive about your objectives;
* Contribute to positive/collaborative environment;
* Share ideas/questions as well as interesting findings; and,
* Follow through with commitments.


## Undergraduate Volunteers
Within the lab, the main expectation for undergraduate students is to engage with the lab. We all come from diverse backgrounds and I do not expect you to come in flying with a Nobel prize study. Be attentive, ask questions, and try something new!

In addition to the above, undergraduate students are expected to:
* Focus on their undergraduate courses. Protect your study time and do not overcommit to lab tasks if you don't have the time;
* As an estimate, try to limit your lab commitment to < 5 hours, or whatever hours you have discussed with Jason during onboarding;
* Try to carve out time to work in the lab environment. This doesn't mean you have to be working on lab tasks - studying for midterms or working on assignments in the vicinity of active research can help you pick up small tips or meaningful interactions with senior students in the lab; and,
* Develop core research skills related to experimental design, basic data collection, as well as reading, writing, and presentation skills.

FROM THE STUDENTS: We expect our undergraduate volunteer peers to:
* Contribute to the collaborative environment, share ideas, suggestions, and questions;
* Provide constructive feedback with respect to lab tasks, academic and student life;
* Participate actively in journal club, coding tutorials or other lab related events; and,
* Be mindful of each other’s commitments and provide support or guidance where necessary.


## Research Staff (RA, Co-op, etc.)
Within the lab, research staff should have a more structured work week and are formally working as paid university employees. While hours of work will depend on the contract, it is best practice to be present in the lab or be available during conventional working hours (between 8am-6pm, depending on hours). While specific roles will differ, research staff are expected to work towards their assigned projects as well as support other students in the lab with your particular expertise.

FROM THE STUDENTS: We expect our research staff to:
* To be available within a reasonable time to help assist research questions and day-to-day tasks;
* To reply to research inquires within a reasonable amount of time, i.e., polite acknowledgement of requests within ~48 hours;
* To be comfortable sharing information about current workload to gain insight on the multitude of job responsibilities;
* [For longterm staff] To have in depth knowledge on techniques, equipment, and analysis methods in the lab for casual first-line student training; and,
* [For longterm staff] To keep up to date on literature in their particular area of expertise. (Jason's note: Take this as a suggestion to prioritize reading time, even when things get busy - the eternal struggle of a life-long academic.)
