# Roles & Expectations

## Everyone
### Code of Conduct
There are many topics we could discuss, but the main focus in this lab is Respect. I expect you all to treat those in your working environment with the same respect and courtesies to promote a positive work environment. Communication should be kind, courteous, and timely. You should not abuse positions of power for personal gain (e.g., supervisory or TA roles), and any such conflicts should be identified early. Any disagreements or breaches of conduct should be identified to the PI, and if necessary, the Graduate Studies chair in Kinesiology (Andrew Laing: actlaing@uwaterloo.ca).

The general student code of conduct for the University of Waterloo can be found  [on the UW website](https://uwaterloo.ca/english-language-institute/current-eli-students/efas-student-handbook/student-code-conduct).

### Scientific Integrity
Throughout your studies, you will no doubt feel the pressure to produce research, report positive findings, and share exciting results. While it is great to be motivated, remember that you should put integrity above all and do not falsify information, manipulate images, or adjust data to serve personal goals. All findings are important (e.g., finding no difference in vascular health between healthy and diseased populations is still positive!), and it is essential that we and our collaborators can trust data coming out of the lab.


### Central University Contact Information
Any additional concerns can also be raised directly with university services, with more information at the following websites:\

## Principal Investigator
Within the lab, my main roles include finding grant money to keep the lights on, mentoring trainees joining the lab, and acting as the main resource in the pipeline for experimental design and data interpretation. I have a casual open-door policy for trainees and always have my phone and email nearby for research or personal emergencies. While not a taskmaster, I will try to keep you on target for your personal research and career goals, and will try to *constructively* push you out of your comfort zone.

Jason's working policies:
* I will acknowledge your emails with 24hrs on working days;
* I request at least 2 weeks notice for writing / reviews requests from students. This includes paper drafts, thesis edits, reference letters, and scholarship applications;


In addition to the above, I promise to:
* Support you in your research life and student life (if you ask);
* Be available for meetings on a regular basis;
* Be patient during the learning process for many lab techniques that you may never have heard of prior to joining the lab (there will be lots!);
* Respond within a reasonable time (<24 hours) to your emails and messages, even if just an acknowledgement of receipt;
* Advocate for your wellness at the upper administrative levels, when possible;
* Encourage and promote equity and diversity in the lab by creating and filling opportunities based on lived experiences that enhance existing perspectives in the lab, and recognizing bias in privileged experiences for which not all individuals have access; and,
* Help you navigate your career path after leaving the lab. This can include helping you network with others at conferences, or helping plan studies directly related to career prospects.

FROM THE STUDENTS: We expect Jason to:
* TBD when we have students join the lab.


## Graduate Students
Within the lab, the main role for graduate students is, first and foremost, to be students. You are not employees and I do not expect you to work as such. Graduate students are expected to work through your courses, set realistic goals unique to your objectives, and work towards those goals through whatever means you learn best. Senior graduate students are expected to offer support to junior students, and in turn, junior students are expected to reach out for help from senior students to share knowledge within the team.

In addition to the above, graduate students are expected to:
* Work towards your research objectives, developed in conjunction with Jason and your supervisory committee. As these goals change term to term (even month to month) students are also expected to;
* Plan regular meetings with supervisory team to meet your research needs;
* Apply for external scholarships;
* Mentor junior lab members;
* Keep detailed research notes throughout your studies;
* Keep track of departmental and external deadlines, and to remind Jason when he forgets; and,
* Maintain a work-life balance that suits your needs! Determine what works best for you and take time to try out new strategies. Grad school is the perfect time to find out if you are a morning person, night owl, weekend warrior, or biphasic sleeper.


FROM THE STUDENTS: We expect our graduate student peers to:
* TBD when we have students join the lab.

## Undergraduate Volunteers
Within the lab, the main expectation for undergraduate students is to engage with the lab. We all come from diverse backgrounds and I do not expect you to come in flying with a Nobel prize study. Be attentive, ask questions, and try something new!

In addition to the above, undergraduate students are expected to:
* Focus on their undergraduate courses. Protect your study time and do not overcommit to lab tasks if you don't have the time;
* Try to carve out time to work in the lab environment. This doesn't mean you have to be working on lab tasks; studying for midterms or working on assignments in the vicinity of active research can help you pick up small tips or meaningful interactions with senior students in the lab;
* Develop core research skills related to experimental design, basic data collection, as well as reading, writing, and presentation skills.

FROM THE STUDENTS: We expect our undergraduate student peers to:
* TBD when we have students join the lab.

## Research Staff (RA, Co-op, etc.)
Within the lab, research staff should have a more structured work week and are formally working as paid university employees. While hours of work will depend on the contract, it is best practice to be present in the lab during conventional working hours (between 8am-6pm, depending on hours). While specific roles will differ, research staff are expected to work towards their assigned projects as well as support other students in the lab with your particular expertise.

FROM THE STUDENTS: We expect our research staff to:
* TBD when we have students join the lab.
