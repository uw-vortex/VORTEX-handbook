e.g., j23au@uwaterloo.ca --> jason.au@uwaterloo.ca

## Health & Safety
All members of the VORTEX lab need to take the following courses prior to working in the lab. All courses (except TCPS2) can be accessed through the [UW Workday](https://uwaterloo.ca/human-resources/) website --> Learning --> Self-enrollment, or through your LEARN page --> Self-Registration
* Employee Safety Orientation (SO1001)
* Workplace Violence & Harassment Awareness (SO1081)
* AccessAbility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) Awareness
* WHMIS 2015 Training (SO2017 - or later)
* [TCPS2 Ethics](https://tcps2core.ca/) Certificate
* [CIHR Sex & Gender training courses](https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/49347.html)

I would also like everyone to take the First Aid course (SO1038) when it becomes available. This full day course will give you Standard First Aid and CPR C with AED training, which is an incredible package for single-day training. It does not hurt to be prepared in the lab with participants coming in and performing exercise trials in a new environment.

As you complete modules, please update the Lab Safety spreadsheet in the V: drive --> 1. Admin --> VORTEX_Safety_Checklist.

## Network Drive (V Drive)
All lab members have access to the VORTEX Research Drive hosted on the UW servers. Each trainee will have their own research folder to house research documents and data to allow remote work, when necessary. To set up the network drive, follow these [instructions on the AHS website](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-health-sciences-computing/how-map-drive). Remember, you must first be logged into the UW VPN if you are off campus. When setting up the drive, please assign it the letter V: so the name is consistent for lab discussions. Our drive location is:

\\\ahsfile\vortexlab$

Jason will submit requests for new trainees to get set up with the drive, which can be accessed by your universal UW ID and password. To access the drive, you will have to log into the [UW VPN](https://uwaterloo.ca/information-systems-technology/services/virtual-private-network-vpn) when off campus.

## Free commercial software to download
1. R and RStudio for statistics and graphing. You will need both R (the actual program), as well as RStudio (the free, user interface that makes R pretty). For both downloads and a mini-tutorial, I recommend checking out [swirlstats](https://swirlstats.com/students.html)
2. [Mendeley desktop](https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop-new/): For reference management during writing. **NOTE**: A recent update for Mac OSX Mojave is interfering with how the Word plug-in pulls citations from Mendeley. If you use a Mac, it may be best to explore other options.
3. [G*Power](https://www.psychologie.hhu.de/arbeitsgruppen/allgemeine-psychologie-und-arbeitspsychologie/gpower.html) for simple statistical sample size calculations
4. [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) + [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor. To upload code you will need to make a github account. This will be the primary method of sharing and updating published code in the lab.
5. [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html) for basic image analysis
6. Bookmark the [Superpower Shiny App](https://arcstats.io/shiny/anova-power/) for more complex simulations for sample size calculations.

## Suggested starting points to learn to code
It is expected that during your time in the VORTEX Lab, you will have to learn some coding basics to push forward your research and run your statistics. Expectations vary depending on the level of the trainee. For instance, at minimum:
* Undergraduate students will be expected to be able to run standard code already written and manipulate some variables to explore data;
* MSc students will be expected to create new scripts to run custom analysis, or edit existing scripts to deal with data in new formats specific to their thesis studies. MSc students are also expected to be able to code their statistics and graphs using RStudio.
* PhD students will be expected to do all of the above and act as primary mentors to junior students learning the basic steps. Depending on career aspirations and learning objectives, I trust that PhD students will decide at what level of coding they want to push themselves. There are diminishing returns to learn to code if you do not intend to use those skills in a future career, so I only ask you learn enough to promote open science in the VORTEX Lab. I do not expect PhD students to learn to make packages / full programs / GUIs.\

### MATLAB:
To begin your MATLAB learning journal, here are some excellent resources to review prior to working in the lab:
* Borrow Jason's copy of 'An Introduction to Programming and Numerical Methods in MATLAB' by SR Otto & JP Denier;
* [MATLAB Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zr_aB7V79DE) on youtube;
* Start reading some 'well-commented' scripts already made in the lab;
* Start playing! The best way to learn is to start trying things out in MATLAB. I have uploaded some 'practice sets' to this repository of problems that you will routinely encounter in cardiovascular sciences; and,
* You can Google just about anything can get excellent resources from forums and StackOverflow. Getting better at coding means learning how to Google your question!

### RStudio
Here are some resources to get started with R and RStudio
* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is an excellent free online textbook made to teach you the basics in R.
* [Tidyverse cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/): We will be using the tidyverse set of packages for most data wrangling and plotting in the lab. These cheatsheets are excellent reminders for how to organize your data with neat visuals for how individual functions manipulate column and row data.
* [swirlstats](https://swirlstats.com/) is a great free resource to learn some R basics. The program works 'inline', so you just follow the prompts in R itself and type along.
* [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday): As with MATLAB, the best way to learn is to start practicing. There is a weekly challenge on Twitter to plot some socially interesting datasets (e.g., Australian fires, college tuition, animal crossing, marble races) using the ggplot method. I encourage you to engage with this community to try out your skills, read code from other participants, and generate some ideas for neat data presentation in the lab.

## Supervisory Onboarding
At the start of every studentship (undergrad and grad), students will meet one-on-one with Jason in the first month of term to establish some core values and expectations for mentorship throughout their time in the lab. In this meeting we will discuss:
* Expected response times for communications;
* Best ways to keep on top of drafts, applications, and meetings;
* Mentorship meeting frequency and structure;
* Working habits;
* Time off / vacations;
* Strategies to stay 'on time' for program milestones (proposal, committee meetings, defences);
* Teaching and volunteer interests;
* Career plans and goals;
* Conference plan and funding expectations;
* Publishing and authorship expectations;
* Expectations to apply for external funding; and,
* Responsibility for research ethics.

## General timelines at a glance
### So you're an undergrad...
There are many different types of undergraduate projects available in the lab. Independent studies can take many different forms with the only defining features being a midterm performance evaluation, and end of term presentations, term papers, and final evaluations. Senior thesis experiences are more involved, with the following suggested timeline (assuming a Fall KIN 431 and Winter KIN 432):

| Date | Milestone | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| March | Initial contact | For the best experience, contact the lab early to ensure an appropriate thesis project can be planned before the start of the Fall term |
| Sept | First meetings | Establish project scope and responsibilities with PI and grad student mentor |
| Sept-Oct | In-lab training | Study prep |
| Oct-Dec | Data collection | Depending on the project, data collection windows may vary |
| Dec | Proposal & Lit Review due | Part of final course evaluations |
| Jan-Feb | Finish data collection and start analysis | ---- |
| Mar | Data analysis | ---- |
| Mar | National Undergrad Research Conference | UG conference hosted by UofT to highlight undergraduate research in Kinesiology |
| Apr | Present to lab group | Practice time! |
| Apr | UW thesis colloquium | Part of final course evaluations |
| Apr | Final papers due | Part of final course evaluations |

### So you're a MSc trainee...
Research-based MSc's run through 6 terms, and include both course requirements and lab research activities. Timelines will widely vary between students, though the typical milestones will be similar. However, I encourage you to involve yourself as much as possible to your own interests throughout your tenure in the lab!

| Term | Milestone | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | 2-3 courses + Lab training | Lead-in time to explore Waterloo and get used to the lab environment |
| 2 | 1-2 courses + Lab pilot work | Goal to be proficient at acquiring data on human participants |
| 3 | Working towards Research Proposal and committee selection + Ethics | Gearing up to run full study |
| 4 | Full Research mode! | Data collection |
| 5 | Full Research mode! | Finish collection + Analysis |
| 6 | Finish writing and Final Defense | MSc achieved |

### So you're a PhD trainee...
It is very difficult to predict the trajectory of a PhD journey as they are largely driven by your interests and motivations. The following is the bare minimum glance at the timelines involved for the major milestones of the program.

| Year | Milestone | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | 2 courses + Lab training | ---- |
| 2 | Comprehensive exams + Research Proposal | Mandatory by end of Year 2 |
| 3 | Full research! | ---- |
| 4 | Full research + Defense | ---- |
