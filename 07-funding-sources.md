# Lab and Student Funding

## Current Sources of Lab Funding
* Start-up Funds (limited supply)

## Stipends
Graduate stipends are set by the department at $20,000/year for MSc students and $23,538/year for PhD students. Supplementary funding from the lab may be available depending on available grants and current projects.

## External awards
It is expected that all students apply for relevant Canadian graduate student awards (i.e., CIHR, NSERC, or OGS). As they say, money begets money, and the success of lab trainees will only benefit other trainees (e.g., free of conference travel money, research funds, lead to larger scholarships). 
<!-- It is important to note that success in acquiring external funding will not directly be added to your stipend - the funds largely go towards reducing departmental costs of supporting graduate students (e.g., you won't be eligible for a TA if you get external funding). However, there are advantages to securing funding: conference opportunities, large boost to your CV (money begets more money), and [selfishly], reduction in lab costs to afford more travel, students, and research opportunities for the team. -->
**The ability to secure funding will not impact internal lab opportunities, available conference support, or result in preferential treatment.**

## Part-time jobs
It is university policy that full-time graduate students should avoid working more than 10 hr/wk with external employees. More information on this policy can be found [here](https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-academic-calendar/general-information-and-regulations/full-time-students).

You are more than welcome to candidly talk to Jason about finance options and work opportunities, or alternatively, and set an appointment with the experts at [Graduate Studies](https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-postdoctoral-affairs/future-students/funding-your-education), or with your [KGSA](https://uwaterloo.ca/kinesiology-graduate-student-association/).

## Conference Funding
### External sources
**Conference funding** may sometimes be found through conference websites. These are generally not guaranteed, but are worth trying for.

**CIHR** offers Institute Community Support program funding for trainees to attend conferences. The availability of these funds change year to year, and with a more substantial application process. Funding is supported up to $1000. Each institute has their own priority areas, funding calls, and success rates. I encourage you to explore any institute that applies to your research (e.g., likely Circulatory and Respiratory Health, Aging, etc.). More information is available on the [CIHR website](https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/36078.html).

### University sources
**Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs** offer some funds to support student travel up to $500. For more information, see the [Graduate Studies website](https://uwaterloo.ca/forms/graduate-studies/graduate-studies-research-travel-assistantship-application).
There are rolling deadlines on April 1, August 1, and December 1.

### Departmental sources
**Applied Health Sciences** offers some funds to support student travel, up to $500. For more information, see the [AHS website](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-health-sciences/current-graduates/policies-procedures/travel-assistance-and-travel-claims).
There are rolling deadlines on April 1, August 1, and December 1.

**Applied Health Sciences** also has the Undergraduate Research Experiential Fund to help undergraduates travel to present their work. More information can be found on the [AHS website](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-health-sciences/current-undergraduates/funding-awards).

### Lab sources
The availability of lab funding will change year-to-year, although I value conference experience for graduate students and will try to fund at least one conference per year for graduate trainees (e.g., at minimum OEP or CSEP)
