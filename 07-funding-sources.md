# Lab and Student Funding

## Current Sources of Lab Funding
Most of our research funding in the lab is publicly-funded (government funding), and therefore we have accountability to declare our sources and report how we are using public funds to improve the lives of Canadians through our research. Below are our current sources of funding to operate the lab:
* Start-up Funds (University of Waterloo)
* NSERC Discovery Grant 2021-2026 (RGPIN-2021-02563)
* NSERC Discovery Launch Supplement 2021-2022 (DGECR-2021-00028)
* CFI-JELF Equipment Grant 2021-2024
* ORF-RI Equipment Grant 2021-2024
* Hallman Undergraduate Research Award 2023
* AGE-WELL Graduate Scholarship in Technology and Aging 2023
* CardieX Arterial Research Initiative 2024

## Stipends
Graduate stipends are set by the department at $20,000/year for MSc students and $24,055/year for PhD students. Supplementary funding from the lab may be available depending on available grants and current projects.

## External awards
It is expected that all students apply for relevant Canadian graduate student scholarships (i.e., CIHR, NSERC, or OGS). As they say, money begets money, and the success of lab trainees will only benefit other trainees (e.g., free up conference travel funds, research funds, lead to larger scholarships). It is important to note that success in acquiring external funding will not directly be added to your stipend - the funds first offset departmental costs of supporting graduate students and then you will receive additional funding to top you up to the minimums.

For example, this is a rough breakdown for a PhD who secures $21,000 of NSERC funding with an original stipend of $27,000 (details may vary year-by-year and by specific provisions in [UW policies](https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-postdoctoral-affairs/current-students/internal-waterloo-awards/presidents-graduate-scholarship)):

| Contribution | Unfunded | Funded |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| TA | $15349 | $0 |
| RA | $9,000 | $0 |
| KHS | $651 | $0 |
| NSERC | $0 | $21,000 |
| PGS | $0 | $10,000 |
| TOTAL | $27,000 | $31,000 |


**The ability to secure funding will not impact internal lab opportunities, available conference support, or result in preferential treatment.**

### Known external awards to keep on your radar
While Jason will promote these awards as much as possible, it is the duty of the applicant to check deadlines, prepare appropriate documents, and secure reference letters well in advance of the application deadline. Jason is more than happy to provide letters of recommendation to anyone in the lab!

#### Undergraduate Funds
[NSERC Undergraduate Student Research (USRA)](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/UG-PC/USRA-BRPC_eng.asp): ~$5,600 to fund a full-time research position (35 hrs/week for 16 weeks) to work as a Research Assistant in the lab. Jason will support one application per year, depending on available NSERC funds.

[Hallman Undergraduate Research Fellowship](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-health-sciences/faculty-staff/research-funding/hallman-undergraduate-research-fellowship): Maximum $10,000 to fund a student salary and research project in the field of health promotion and education. Jason will support one application per year, dependent upon high GPA (>85% cumulative average).

[President's upper-year awards](https://uwaterloo.ca/student-awards-financial-aid/undergraduate-awards/presidents-upper-year-awards#:~:text=each%20award%20name.-,President's%20Research%20Award,either%20in%20person%20or%20remotely): Available to undergraduates who entered first year with a 95% average, and maintained at least a 80% average after first year. Can claim up to two $1500 awards to participate in research experiences throughout your undergraduate degree. Inquire with Jason if you are interested pursuing this in the VORTEX Lab.

#### Graduate Funds
[Mitacs-Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Summer Program](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/mitacs-jsps-summer-program): ~$8,000 living expenses + ~$5,000 research funds + flights to undertake a 12-week internship in Japan with a project collaborator. Applications are typically due in December and require a full project plan with Jason and collaborator to apply.

[CSEP Scholarship for Persons from Underrepresented Groups](https://csep.ca/en/about-csep/awards--grants-/csep-scholarship-for-persons-from-underrepresented-groups-): $2,500 award for a CSEP certified or student member in good standing to increase participation in STEM research. Underrepresented groups are defined according to the [Tri-Agency Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/NSERC-CRSNG/EDI-EDI/Dimensions-Charter_Dimensions-Charte_eng.asp).

[Ontario Graduate Scholarship / Queen Elizabeth II Scholarship](https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-postdoctoral-affairs/current-students/external-awards/ontario-graduate-scholarship-ogs-and-queen-elizabeth-ii): $15,000 award for a single year. For MSc applicants, your UW application also serves as your OGS/QEII scholarship application. For current grad students, you must submit a separate application to the graduate administrator following the instructions on the UW page. Typically due February 1st.

##### Tri-council awards
The following awards are the key major awards that graduate students are expected to apply for. You are only allowed to apply to one of the tri-council agencies per application cycle - please discuss with Jason whether you are planning to apply for CIHR or NSERC. (Note: The third 'tri-council', SSHRC, rarely applies to our research and is usually not an option for our research program)

[NSERC/CIHR CGS-M](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/cgsm-bescm_eng.asp): $17,500 award for a single year. The Canada Graduate Scholarship (Master's) program is harmonized so that there is a single application form and you just declare whether you are aiming for a NSERC or CIHR award. The application deadline is usually December 1, with internal conversations with Jason to be conducted by November 1.

[NSERC/CIHR PGS-D or CGS-D](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/pg-cs/bellandpostgrad-belletsuperieures_eng.asp): The PostGraduate Scholarship (Doctoral) and Canada Graduate Scholarship (Doctoral) awards provide maximum 3 years of support at either $21,000 or $35,000 per year, respectively. Applying to the PGS-D program automatically considers you for the CGS-D program - CGS-D awardees are usually the top percentage of all applicants. The application deadline is usually mid-October (~October 15), with internal conversations with Jason to be conducted by early September.


## Part-time jobs
It is university policy that full-time graduate students should avoid working more than 10 hr/wk with external employers. More information on this policy can be found on the [Graduate Studies website](https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-academic-calendar/general-information-and-regulations/full-time-students).

You are more than welcome to candidly talk to Jason about finance options and work opportunities, or alternatively, set an appointment with the experts at [Graduate Studies](https://uwaterloo.ca/graduate-studies-postdoctoral-affairs/future-students/funding-your-education), or with your [KGSA](https://uwaterloo.ca/kinesiology-graduate-student-association/).

## Conference Funding
### External sources
**Conference funding** may sometimes be found through conference websites. These are generally not guaranteed, but are worth trying for.

**CIHR** offers Institute Community Support program funding for trainees to attend conferences. The availability of these funds changes year-to-year, and with a more substantial application process. Funding is supported up to $1000. Each institute has their own priority areas, funding calls, and success rates. I encourage you to explore any institute that applies to your research (e.g., likely Circulatory and Respiratory Health, Aging, etc.). More information is available on the [CIHR website](https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/36078.html).

### University sources
**Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs** offer some funds to support student travel up to $500. For more information, see the [Graduate Studies website](https://uwaterloo.ca/forms/graduate-studies/graduate-studies-research-travel-assistantship-application).
There are rolling deadlines on April 1, August 1, and December 1. Make sure to submit these applications **as early as possible**, as these funds run on a first-come first-serve basis.

*Note from Jason*: There is a particular application sequence to maximize funding support for travel. Please use the following steps to secure funds from GSPA, the Faculty, and KHS.
1. First apply for the [Graduate Student Research Dissemination Award](https://uwaterloo.ca/forms/graduate-studies/graduate-student-research-dissemination-award-application-0) with sign off from Jason
2. After approval of the $500 award, apply for Faculty and Departmental travel assistance. The form can be found on the KHS Graduate Community Group on LEARN under: Table of Contents > KHS Forms > Travel/Expense Claim and Conference Information > Department/Faculty Conference Funding Application Form. Send this completed/signed form to the KHS Graduate Coordinator along with a copy of your GSRDA approval email from GSPA.

### Departmental sources
**Health** offers some funds to support student travel, up to $200 for MSc students, and up to $300 for PhD students. For more information, see the [AHS website](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-health-sciences/current-graduates/policies-procedures/travel-assistance-and-travel-claims).
There are rolling deadlines on April 1, August 1, and December 1.

**Health** also has the Undergraduate Research Experiential Fund to help undergraduates travel to present their work. More information can be found on the [AHS website](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-health-sciences/current-undergraduates/funding-awards).

### Lab sources
The availability of lab funding will change year-to-year, although I value conference experience for graduate students and will try to fund at least one conference per year for graduate trainees (e.g., at minimum OEP or CSEP)
