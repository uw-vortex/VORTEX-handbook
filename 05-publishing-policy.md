# Publishing in the VORTEX lab

## Policy on authorship
Determining authorship can be a contentious process. To ensure appropriate credit is given for significant contributions to potentially publishable papers, I have outlined key considerations below, based on the [COPE Guidelines](https://publicationethics.org/files/2003pdf12_0.pdf), and considerations within the physiological sciences:

* All authors must meet 3 criteria:
    1. Substantial contributions to one of:
        * Study conception/design: This includes authors who are no longer in the lab, but came up with the core idea
        * Acquisition of data: Individuals must be integral to the acquisition (e.g., would the study have been completed without you?). This includes collaborators who recruited, scheduled, or managed participants on a day-to-day basis. For example, entering LabChart comments does not qualify authorship, but taking care of the testing environment while a senior trainee operates the ultrasound does.
        * Analysis/Interpretation of data: By default, I expect the primary trainee to be the point-person, delegating analysis tasks to those best suited to the task. As this may largely be beyond the view of the PI, this fluid environment should be noted and identified in regular meetings for early transparency.
    2. Drafting/Reviewing the paper for important intellectual content: I expect all identified contributing authors from (1) to engage in the review process. This can be daunting for junior trainees out-of-field, but I encourage you to put in the effort to contribute in depth to a discussion point, and particularly the story-crafting element of the written work.
    3. Final approval of the version to be published: All authors should be aware when and where the final paper will be submitted. No surprises!
* To be considered an author, I expect that **in a hypothetical emergency** an individual should be able to present the work at a conference to colleagues in our field. (I don't expect you to **actually** do this, just in theory!)
* In an ideal world, I would like a potential author list to be presented to the lab group prior to the start of the project. This living document is intended to be updated through the study, and discussed as a group at regular lab meetings to ensure no contribution goes un-noticed.
* Author Order: In addition to determining authorship, the order of authors on a paper has implications for external evaluation in research scholarships, grants, and professional graduate programs. As above, this determination can be difficult to navigate and should be approached with clear communications and expectations from all involved authors. All decisions must be approved by all authors, but the final word and responsibility for author conflicts will reside with the senior author. The following are guidelines for determining order:
    1. First author: Typically the individual who performed the majority of work in data collection, analysis, and writing. For graduate research directly related to dissertation studies, this will always be the graduate student in charge of the project. Undergraduate thesis projects are not always guaranteed to be published and authorship will be addressed on a case-by-case basis.
    2. Second author: Typically the individual who was the go-to person for the lead author and played a major role in either the analysis, interpretation, or drafting of the manuscript.
    3. Middle authorship: All other contributors will be listed in order of major contributions to the project. In the event of no clear difference in contribution, middle authors will be listed alphabetically. Fear not, the specifics about middle authorship typically does not count for much during evaluations.
    4. Senior author: This is the last listed author in most physiology/engineering journals. This individual is typically viewed as overseeing the research and providing the core infrastructure necessary for the work to be done (e.g., funding, equipment, major input in research design). For all work coming out of the VORTEX lab, the senior author by default will be Jason, unless decided otherwise early in the project (as in the case of collaborations with other labs).
    5. Corresponding author: This author is indicated as the primary contact point for the study, with address, email, and name indicated on the publication. Except in rare circumstances, the senior author will be listed as the corresponding author. The main reason for this is that students don't always retain university email addresses beyond their graduate studies. Regardless, the lead student author will be sent all correspondence and credited on all (if any) media releases for the work.

## Authorship after leaving the lab
Another difficult situation commonly encountered by students is how to manage the publishing process after you have completed your degree and have moved onto new jobs or opportunities outside the academic environment. Most importantly, every opportunity will be given to lead graduate students to get first author publications resulting from their thesis work. The following guidelines are to help move this process forward and outlines contingency plans in the event this process does not become feasible:
* Prior to leaving the lab, a 'lingering publication plan' will be discussed in the exit interview;
* If a paper draft is not adequately prepared up to 3 years after the end of data collection, a conversation will be initiated to re-assign the project to a different student lead to expedite the publication;
* If a student willingly relinquishes responsibility to finish a paper, Jason will re-assign the project to a different student lead.

With respect to the above two points (re-assignment), the original student lead will always be included as a contributing author and will be expected to help approve the final version of the manuscript prior to publication.

## List of target journals
To give a **very** arbitrary idea of journal standing, I'm going to list the most recent impact factor (as of 2020); however, this metric does not represent the quality or applicability of the journal (don't @ me). An impact factor is calculated by dividing the number of times articles were cited in a journal, by the number of articles that have been published, within a 2-year period. So a journal that gets cited a lot and does not publish many papers will have a large impact factor - you can see how the system can be 'gamed' by increasing the rejection rate. **Friends don't let friends believe in impact factors.**

## How to recognize Predatory Journals
After publishing a few articles, trainees will start to receive 'predatory journal' requests, asking them to consider submitting to their journal for a 'modest' publication fee with rapid turn-around. There is no explicit definition of a predatory journal, but in general, these are periodicals that exist solely to make money by having authors pay huge 'article processing charges' (APCs) with little to no scientific review or oversight, essentially promising an exchange of publication-for-money. Now, it is extremely difficult to identify these journals given that their business strategy is remarkably similar to actual trusted journals who still charge large APCs, but with legitimate peer review. An attempt was made about a decade ago (i.e., see Wikipedia articles about [Beall's List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beall%27s_List)), but due to litigation by predatory companies, it is not possible to just look up these journals in a central database. Instead, it is up to **you** to identify less-than-reputable journals by doing your due diligence. In general, you can look for:
* Spelling mistakes in the invitation email, website, or published articles from the journal.
* References your previous papers in an invitation email - this usually indicates your data was trawled through websites to link your name and recent article titles.
* Is there an easily accessible editorial board for the journal?
* Are there excessive fees for publication?
* Are there unnecessary assurances that the journal is indexed in search engines?
* **When in doubt, ask Jason!**
