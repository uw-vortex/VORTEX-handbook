## Health & Wellness
> "150 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week, in bouts of 10 minutes or more, **AND** muscle and bone strengthening activities using major muscle groups, at least 2 days per week" - The Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines for Adults aged 18-64 Years.

Policy #1 is to maintain your physical and mental well-being in the face of the day-to-day challenges in an academic environment. Being in a kinesiology department, we are acutely aware of the enormous benefits, but also the incredible barriers, to regular physical activity. We encourage you to make physical activity a fixed component of your workweek and take care of yourselves in the midst of your research week.

## Inclusivity and diversity
Enjoyable, high-quality research can only be conducted when you feel safe, secure, and supported. All group members are thus dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, and/or religion. We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our group in any form, and we ask all members of the community to respect the following core principles:
* All communication, be it online or in person, should be appropriate for a professional audience, and be considerate of people from different cultural backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any time.
* Be kind to others and do not insult or put down other group members.
* Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.
* Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
* Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
* Contribute to discussions in meetings with a constructive, positive approach
* Be mindful of talking over others when discussing in groups, and be willing to hear out the ideas of others.


Jason will discuss the above core principles with lab members who violate these rules, no matter their level of study, or how specialized or needed their skill set. If inappropriate behaviour persists after this initial discussion, formal processes, in line with UW's work practice policies, will commence. To report a breach of code of conduct, please contact Jason Au; all communication will be treated as confidential. If you do not feel comfortable contacting Jason directly, please feel free to contact either Andrew Laing (Associate Chair of Graduate Studies), or Russ Tupling (Department Chair).

The above policies were heavily borrowed from the BRG lab run by Christopher Jackson under a CC-BY 4.0 license. We encourage others to also critical evaluate these policies and adapt them for their own purposes.

### Central University Contact Information
Any additional concerns can also be raised directly with university services, with more information at the following websites:\

## Dress code
There is no dress code, but please present yourselves in the lab ready to potentially interact with participants, faculty, and research visitors. Otherwise, typical lab safety dress code applies - closed-toed shoes, limit fragrances, and good personal hygiene for enclosed spaces!

## Work Hours Policy
There is no work hours policy. The below are suggestions to get you started in exploring your personal research work preferences:

**When people work**: As a faculty member, I will reliably be working weekdays between the hours of 8am-6pm. During this time, I do expect students to at least have access to email, and be available for meetings scheduled in advance - no surprise meetings from me. I do not *expect* students to work weekends or evenings, but you are always free to use your time as you choose.

**Where people work**: Team members should work where they feel most comfortable (i.e., office, lab, home, coffee shop, park bench). I do encourage you to regularly work in the presence of others, as I believe the team environment is highly important for casual learning. There are many things you can pick up on by just being present in the lab or office, whether that be from more senior students, or students from other research teams. I specifically encourage undergraduate lab members to spend time working in the lab for a rapid pick-up of lab lingo, working habits, and tech know-how!

**Working alone**: The only hardline lab policy regards working alone in the lab. If you are testing participants, there must be at **minimum** two lab members present in the lab (just in case there is an adverse event). If you are working on tasks outside of lab hours, you should follow the [University working alone policies](https://uwaterloo.ca/safety-office/occupational-health-safety/working-alone-guideline).

## Vacation
People need breaks! The lab is more than happy to accommodate any personal travel plans - just try to let us know in advance so we can rearrange testing sessions, analyses, and lab activities!

## Soft Policies / Tips

### How to be a GREAT labmate
You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your labmates! Part of the challenge of lab work is learning how to navigate teamwork in a largely independent working environment. While you will have your own projects, you will need the help of your labmates to solve problems, get trustworthy feedback, and build a support structure for when academic times get tough (e.g., paper rejections, thesis prep, job hunt). While every person is different, here are some quick tips to get integrated into the lab:
* **Show up to things**;
* **Be present**;
* **Talk about authorship up-front**
* **RSVP right away**
* **Ask before you borrow equipment**
* **Be cognizant of shared lab time and resources**
* **Keep notes about method successes and failures that may help others**
* **Don't hold onto small offenses**
* **Speak up about problems you encounter - there are likely others who will be affected by them**
* **Follow through on action items with a timeline - don't leave your labmates hanging**
