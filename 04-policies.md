# Policies

## Dress code
There is no dress code, but please present yourselves in the lab ready to potentially interact with participants, faculty, and research visitors. Otherwise, typical lab safety dress code applied - closed-toed shoes, limit fragrances, and good personal hygiene for enclosed spaces!

## Work Hours Policy
There is no work hours policy. The below are suggestions to get you started in exploring your personal research work preferences:

**When people work**: As a faculty member, I will reliably be working weekdays between the hours of 8am-6pm. During this time, I do expect students to at least have access to email, and be available for meetings scheduled in advance - no surprise meetings from me. I do not *expect* students to work weekends or evenings, but you are always free to use your time as you choose.

**Where people work**: Team members should work where they feel most comfortable (i.e., office, lab, home, coffee shop, park bench). I do encourage you to regularly work in the presence of others, as I believe the team environment is highly important for casual learning. There are many things you can pick up on by just being present in the lab or office, whether that be from more senior students, or students from other research teams. I specifically encourage undergraduate lab members to spend time working in the lab for a rapid pick-up of lab lingo, working habits, and tech know-how!

**Working alone**: The only hardline policy is when you are working alone in the lab. If you are testing participants, there must be at **minimum** two lab members present in the lab (just in case there is an adverse event). If you are working on tasks outside of lab hours, you should follow the [University working alone policies](https://uwaterloo.ca/safety-office/occupational-health-safety/working-alone-guideline)

## Vacation
People need breaks! The lab is more than happy to accommodate any personal travel plans - just try to let us know in advance so we can rearrange testing sessions, analyses, and lab activities!
