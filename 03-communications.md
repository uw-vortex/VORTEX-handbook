# Lab communications

## Communication
The primary method of communication in the lab is UW email, mostly to ensure a record of work-relevant discussions within the labspace. While I do not expect you to have constant access to email, it is expected that you make a reasonable attempt to respond to emails within a timely manner (let's say <24 hours for intra-lab communications as a common courtesy), even if it is a quick acknowledgement. For example, if you send me an email asking for edits on a paper, I probably won't get that back to you in an hour, but I will acknowledge the task and give you an idea on a timeline.

**A Note on Emails**: Email habits and working hours are flexible qualities. As a lab, we will decide our comfort level sending and receiving emails in and out of work hours, and evolve this policy over time. Personally, I recognize email stress can be difficult to manage, and will try not send students emails outside work hours to reduce your cognitive load.

We also have a lab Whatsapp group for more casual communication! This includes more time-sensitive topics, or lab socials. We won't leave you out of the chat!

**COVID-19 Updates**: Given the absence of in person communications, we will be using Microsoft Teams to keep a virtual lab space to discuss issues, research plans, and lab-related topics. Teams is supported by UW so it should integrate well with your UW accounts.

Finally, we have an emergency contact list posted in the lab with everyone's personal contacts - stay in touch!

## Meetings

> This could have been an e-mail.


### VORTEX Lab Meetings
Full group lab meetings occur weekly. This Fall 2020, we will have meetings **Tuesday @ 10:00am**. The general format of lab meetings are:
* general announcements;
* research issues to be considered by the group;
* individual updates; and,
* a learning outcome for the group. The learning outcome will change week to week;  for example: student data presentations, student practice presentations, journal club, career development, science development, science discussion, tutorial lecture/demonstration, etc. The schedule for each term will be circulated near the start of the semester.

### Mentorship Meetings
In addition to weekly meetings and casual conversations, each student will be asked for one-on-one meetings with the PI once a month for a more formal mentorship structure. The goal of these meetings is to:
* talk through difficulties or roadblocks in the lab;
* to identify and work on individual strengths and weaknesses; and,
* to ensure an open line of communication between the student and the PI.
The structure of these meetings will vary between students, and will be shaped by both the student and PI over time.
**The first mentorship meeting is more structured and will follow the steps outlined in the Onboarding document**
