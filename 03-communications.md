# Lab communications

## Communication
**Emails**: The primary method of communication in the lab is UW email, mostly to ensure a record of work-relevant discussions within the labspace. While I do not expect you to have constant access to email, it is expected that you make a reasonable attempt to respond to emails within a timely manner (let's say <24 hours for intra-lab communications as a common courtesy), even if it is a quick acknowledgement. For example, if you send me an email asking for edits on a paper, I probably won't get that back to you in an hour, but I will acknowledge the task and give you an idea on a timeline.

*A Note on Emails*: Email habits and working hours are highly personal. Personally, I find email stress to be very real and very difficult (e.g., thinking about work in off hours), and will try not send students emails outside work hours to reduce your cognitive load. I include the following post-script to my outgoing emails to try and ease the collective cognitive load:
"My working day may not be your working day. Please do not feel obliged to reply to this email outside your normal working hours."

**Whatsapp**: We also have a lab Whatsapp group for more casual communication. This includes more time-sensitive topics, or lab socials. We won't leave you out of the chat!

**COVID-19 Updates: Microsoft Teams**: Given the absence of in person communications, we will be using Microsoft Teams to keep a virtual lab space to discuss issues, research plans, and lab-related topics. Teams is supported by UW so it should integrate well with your UW accounts.

Finally, we have an emergency contact list posted in the lab with everyone's personal contacts - stay in touch!

## Meetings

> "This could have been an e-mail" - Said every grad student ever.


### VORTEX Lab Meetings
Full group lab meetings occur weekly. This Fall 2020, we will have meetings **Tuesday @ 12:30pm**. The general format of lab meetings are:
* general announcements;
* research issues to be considered by the group;
* individual updates; and,
* a learning outcome for the group. The learning outcome will change week to week;  for example: student data presentations, student practice presentations, journal club, career development, science development, science discussion, tutorial lecture/demonstration, etc. The schedule for each term will be circulated near the start of the semester.

### Mentorship Meetings
In addition to weekly meetings and casual conversations, each student will be asked for one-on-one meetings with the PI once a month for a more formal mentorship structure. The goal of these meetings is to:
* talk through difficulties or roadblocks in the lab;
* to identify and work on individual strengths and weaknesses; and,
* to ensure an open line of communication between the student and the PI.
The structure of these meetings will vary between students, and will be shaped by both the student and PI over time.
**The first mentorship meeting is more structured and will follow the steps outlined in the Onboarding document**

## Writing drafts with Jason
Jason is more than willing to help review your term papers, literature reviews, proposals, manuscript drafts, and thesis in advance of your submission dates. Over the course of your research career, you will no doubt be on the receiving end of many types of editors, each with their own style of feedback. To give you an idea of what to expect from Jason, the below points try to capture his review style and expectations.
* Jason will use the track-changes feature in word to mark his edits. To help him remember what was discussed in earlier versions, you don't need to clear all mark-up in subsequent versions - it will be easier to see what sections have been addressed in depth.
* Jason will use comments to identify unclear areas (sometimes excessively), generally including specific examples or suggested revisions to clarity sentences.
* Don't be alarmed if the document comes back heavily marked with grammar suggestions, sentence re-writes, and many small comments, particularly in your first few papers - this is just Jason showing he cares about your work and wants you to 'learn-by-revision' for his personal style of writing.

In addition, Jason has some particular writing quirks that he asks you to adopt:
* In general, Jason prefers Arial 12pt font, justified 1" margins, single spaced, 6 point space gap between paragraphs with no tabs, and single spaces after periods - you are welcome to challenge him that other formats are superior, but good luck :)
* When writing papers, Jason will ask you to aim for a 1-2 page introduction, 4-6 page discussion, but whatever length methods and results necessary to communicate the findings.
* Some general writing tips:
  * Try to avoid starting sentences with leading clauses (e.g., However,... Given the reduced heart rate,... Rather than attribute the findings to X,...);
  *  Break up lengthy written sections with subheadings;
  * Try to avoid non-specific adjectives (e.g., there was a large effect of exercise vs exercise induced a 10% increase in fitness)
  * First person writing is okay (i.e., we observed...)
