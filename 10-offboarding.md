# Offboarding

## Undergraduate Students
You've completed your term objectives and submitted your final papers! Now what? Before you leave the lab, there are a few things you need to finalize:

### Data!
Before leaving, I ask that you touch base with your graduate supervisor to identify where any data you worked on during the term is located. If you were working off your personal computer, make sure that everything is backed up on the lab V: drive, or on-site in the lab computers.

### Evaluations
As part of undergraduate coursework, Jason will be evaluating you at two points throughout the term: a midterm performance evaluation which is not associated with a grade, and a final performance evaluation that will comprise your lab experiential learning grade. Be sure to review this with Jason and ask any clarifying questions before the end of term and mark submission.

### Post-lab support
While your time with us is complete, all undergraduates are welcome to participate in lab activities throughout the full academic year you are involved in the lab (September to August). Feel free to continue participating remotely on Teams, and joining lab meetings, but we won't assign you any additional work unless we have established ongoing commitment to research projects or volunteering in the lab.

## Graduate Students
You've successfully defended and submitted your final thesis! Now what? Before you move on to bigger and better things, there are a few things you need to do prior to leaving the lab:

### Data!
Before leaving, I require you to organize your entire research database in the V: drive network folder. This includes all information from the proposal, ethics application, data collection material, raw data, analyzed data files, statistics files and code, final drafts and final figures, and all presentations you presented during your time in the lab. While none of this material will be used without proper acknowledgement, it is essential that we have complete records of all work done in the lab.

### Lingering Papers
After leaving regular hours in the lab, it can be very difficult to find time to put the finishing touches and making major revisions after reviewer feedback. In light of this, before students leave the lab, we will arrange a personalized paper writing plan that works best for the student. A general approach is listed under the lab 'publishing-policy.md' document, which is subject to personalization depending on the student and scope of the project.

### Exit Interview
Prior to leaving the lab, I will ask to have a final debrief meeting with you to review your experience working with the group. This includes reviewing the highs and the lows, the challenges and the successes, and how we can continue to support you after you leave the lab.

### Party!
Save the date! After every defense, please save the afternoon / evening / early morning for celebration time with the lab. We'll be sad to see you go, but we'll make sure to send you off in style.
