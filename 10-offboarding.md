# Offboarding

You've successfully defended and submitted your final thesis! Now what? Before you move on to bigger and better things, there are a few things you need to do prior to leaving the lab:

## Data!
Before leaving, I require you to organize your entire research database in the lab network folder. This includes all information from the proposal, ethics application, data collection material, raw data, analyzed data files, statistics files and code, final drafts and final figures, and all presentations you presented during your time in the lab. While none of this material will be used without proper acknowledgement, it is essential that we have complete records of all work done in the lab.

## Lingering Papers
After leaving regular hours in the lab, it can be very difficult to find time to put the finishing touches and making major revisions after reviewer feedback. In light of this, before students leave the lab, we will arrange a personalized paper writing plan that works best for the student. A general approach is listed under the lab 'publishing-policy.md' document, which is subject to personalization depending on the student and scope of the project.

## Exit Interview
Prior to leaving the lab, I will ask to have a final debrief meeting with you to review your experience working with the group. This includes reviewing the highs and the lows, the challenges and the successes, and how we can continue to support you after you leave the lab.
